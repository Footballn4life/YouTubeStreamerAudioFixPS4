# YouTubeStreamerAudioFixPS4
This fix was for online video game streamers' who had issues involving recording the use of two separate microphone's on OBS Studio.
There was only one solution which worked according to another YouTuber. I used a similiar method, however I completed the solution to
the problem all by my own understanding and knowledge, with no credit given to anyone but myself for this solution. I have made comments
on the YouTube video instructing users on how to fully solve the problem. I made the fix perfect allowing for the original idea to fully
be solved. I am the only one in the world to have fully solved this problem and to post a solution to this fix. I did also claim on Twitter
the rights to this information, alotted with copyrighting. 
There is a video in process of being made and uploaded to Youtube with the full instructional video, on my YouTube channel Footballn4life
